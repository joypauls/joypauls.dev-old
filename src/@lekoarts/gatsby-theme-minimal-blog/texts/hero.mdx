  Welcome<span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">&#10024;</span> I'm Joy!
</Text>

I'm focused on introducing concepts in the huge and messy world of applied mathematics 
in accessible and interesting ways. Along with some actual 
introductory material for new learners, I hope to write content that feels inviting 
and welcoming regardless of where you are in your educational journey!

Are you brand new to the field or trying to break in and would like to see more of a certain type 
of content? Let me know!
