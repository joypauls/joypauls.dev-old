## Rolling the Dice

put stuff about pmf etc. here

$$
D_{20} = \text{a single roll of a 20-sided die}
$$

pmf

$$
p(D_{20} = k) = \frac{1}{20} 
$$

where $k=1,2,...,20$.

### Expected Value

So we now know that for any single d20 roll, all outcomes are equally probable. But what about after many rolls - what is the average roll we expect in a session?
To answer this question we turn to the concept of expected value.

$$
E[X] = \sum^{n}_{k=1} k p(k)
$$

Here is what it looks like for the d20

$$
E[D_{20}] = \sum_{k=1}^{20} k p(k) = \sum_{k=1}^{20} k (\frac{1}{20}) = 1(\frac{1}{20}) + 2(\frac{1}{20}) + \cdots + 20(\frac{1}{20}) = 10.5
$$
