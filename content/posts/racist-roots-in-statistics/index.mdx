The development of statstics shares its roots with the advancement of white supremacist ideas and
the development of **eugenics**, the discredited practice of "improving" the human gene pool by the 
exclusion of those deemed inferior and inclusion of those deemed superior. Guessing which groups 
have been historically included in each category is left as an exercise to the reader. The term eugenics 
was coined by none other than statistical founding father and cousin of Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, 
o describe his own research.[^1]

## In Their Own Words

Don't take my word for it - here they are in their own words. Keep in mind that these are not statements pulled from private correspondence or
cherry picked out of context. These men were proud of their work, and proud to represent them in public forums. As Angela Saini points out, this 
is not the story of uniquely evil men, but the story of dangerous ideas that gained footholds in mainstream culture with the help of influential 
scientists.[^1]

#### Francis Galton (1822-1911)

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Out of the hundreds and thousands of species that have been tamed, very few indeed are fertile when their liberty is restricted and their 
struggles for livelihood are abolished; those which are so, and are otherwise useful to man, becoming domesticated. There is perhaps some 
connection between this obscure action and the disappearance of most savage races when brought into contact with high civilization, though 
there are other and well-known concomitant causes. But while most barbarous races disappear, some, like the negro, do not.

##### His legacy in statistics?

#### Karl Pearson (1857-1936)

He wrote

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
My view â€“ and I think it may be called the scientific view of a nation, is that of an organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal 
efficiency by insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency 
by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races.

In his 1901 book.[^3]


##### His legacy in statistics?

#### Ronald Fisher (1890-1962)

He formally objected to a worldwide statement decrying racism after World War II stating that human groups, i.e. racial groups, differ profoundly
"in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development" and concluded that the practical international problem is that of learning 
to share the resources of this planet amicably with persons of materially different nature" as opposed to the project of discrediting racial 
pseudoscience.[^4]

### Eugenics and Objective Science

Let's return to Galton. We don't need to read between the lines to discover his aims; he tells us in *Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and Aims*.[^2]

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Eugenics is the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to 
the utmost advantage. 
</span>

In a discussion led by Karl Pearson we see even more illuminating comments. From Pearson:



The author H.G. Wells actually paticipated in these discussions too. Although he was sceptical of eugenics from the start, he concludes with this 
thought:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
The way of nature has always been to slay the hindmost, and there is still no other way, unless we can prevent those who would become the 
hindmost being born. It is in the sterilization of failures, and not in the selection of successes for breeding, that the possibility of 
an improvement of the human stock lies.
