## Before We Dive In

$$
e = 2.71828...
$$

**Euler's Number**, the number $$e$$, appears almost everywhere in mathematics and I mean that literally! 
We are taught to just accept $$e$$ as one of those weird special numbers living in the same plane of 
existence as $$\pi$$. Like $$\pi$$, $$e$$ is a **transcendental number**, meaning that it is not algebraic. 
Now that actually isn't really all that special - the set of transcendental numbers numbers is 
uncountably infinite whereas the set of algebraic numbers is countable, so there are actually more 
transcendental numbers than not[^1]! 

So why does $$e$$ get all this special treatment? Why is it everywhere? By the end of this series we will 
see fascinating lines drawn from differential calculus to complex analysis to combinatorics, and even our 
second favorite transcendental number, $$\pi$$, will make an appearance! All these connections courtesy of $$e$$.

To begin to understand what makes it special, humor me and try to forget everything you know about Euler's number.

## Exponential Growth From Scratch

Let's start by considering the simplest family of functions with parameter $$a$$ that grow exponentially with 
respect to time $$t$$,

$$
f(t) = a^t
$$

where $$a \in \mathbb{R}^+$$ just to make it easy on us. You may find it difficult to just automatically 
envision what happens here, but this is a case where a picture make it crystal clear. Let's look at a 
plot showing $$f$$ for a few different values of $$a$$ to build some inuition:

PLOT HERE

We can group the dynamics of this family into 3 categories:

- When $$0<a<1$$, we have **exponential decay**
- When $$a=1$$, $$f$$ is constant
- When $$a>1$$, we have **exponential growth**

### Important Principle: $$f^{\prime}(t) \propto f(t)$$

If we inspect the plot closer, it looks pretty clear that while our inital value $$f(0)$$ is always $$1$$, 
the derivative at $$0$$, $$f^{\prime}(0)$$, varies wildly. How does this impact the dynamics of $$f$$?

$$
\begin{aligned} 
f^{\prime}(t) &= \frac{d}{dt} a^t \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^{t + h} - a^{t}}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^t (a^{h} - 1)}{h} \\
&= a^t \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^{h} - 1}{h} \\
&= f^{\prime}(0) a^t 
\end{aligned}
$$


I think it's worth stopping here for a second because this really is a special property of exponential growth. 
What this tells us is that to know the dervative at any point in time $$t_i$$, all we need to know is $$f(t_i)$$ and 
$$f^{\prime}(0)$$. **Its rate of change is proportional to itself**. If we let $$k = f^{\prime}(0)$$, 
we can express that in notation,

$$
f^{\prime}(t) = k a^t \implies f^{\prime}(t) \propto f(t)
$$ 

where $$k$$ is a unique constant given the choice of parameter $$a$$.

Another way that puts this concept in perspective is looking at this expression after solving for $$a$$:

$$
f'(1) = f'(0)a^{1} \implies a = \frac{f'(1)}{f'(0)}
$$

So the parameter $$a$$, that we choose up front, describes how quickly the rate of growth moves from 
its starting level to the level at time 1. In other words, $$k$$ is the initial shove the system gets, 
the rate of change at the start; if 
the shove is too small then the system shrinks down. But if it's strong enough, it will grow! The 
consequence of that shove is $$a$$, which dictates the growth of the system from there on out since 
the rate of growth is proportional to itself.


### Where the Magic Happens: $$k=1$$

Now that we know how critical the initial shock $$k$$ is to understanding the dynamics if $$f$$, 
what else can we learn? Let's use a time tested strategy - plug in an easy value and see what 
happens! If we give $$f$$ the inital shock of $$k=1$$, what is the corresponding $$a$$ needed to 
write out the expression for $$f(t)$$? Remembering the last question this is the same as asking 
what the consequence of an initial shock $$1$$ is.

Well, without doing any math, we can already see this relationship is pretty cool: 

$$
f^{\prime}(t) = f(t)
$$

When the initial shock to $$f$$ is $$1$$, the rate of change is **exactly the same as $$f$$ itself**. 
Try to wrack your brain to think of other example of this - you'll find none! I don't think it is too 
ridiculous to say that this is like looking at the archetype of growth. If that's true, we need to meet 
this special $$f$$ face to face so we can thank her. To do that we need to find $$a$$.

Let $$k=1$$:

$$
f^{\prime}(t) = 1 a^t
$$

So then at time $$t=0$$, using the limit definition of the derivative,

$$
\begin{aligned} 
f^{\prime}(0) = a^{0} &\implies \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^{0+h} - a^{0}}{h} = a^{0} \\
&\implies \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^{h} - 1}{h} = 1
\end{aligned} 
$$

and as $$h$$ gets smaller and smaller, and finally approaches 0, we have

$$
a^h - 1 = h \implies a = (h+1)^{\frac{1}{h}}
$$

so that $$a = \lim_{h \to 0} (h+1)^{\frac{1}{h}}$$. Hold on, this is the "archetype of growth", 
we can't sit idly by while $$a$$ remains as a limit...
let's at least give it an approximation! Plugging in a really small $$h$$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a &\approx (1 + 0.000001)^{\frac{1}{0.000001}} \\
&\approx 2.71828... \\
&\approx e
\end{aligned}
$$

That looks familiar! Indeed, once others knew that this special value of $$a$$ was important, a name had to be 
given to it. Now our first definition of Euler's number is revealed:

$$
e = \lim_{h \to 0} (h+1)^{\frac{1}{h}}
$$


### A Quick Look at the Convergence Characteristsics

## So Why is $$e^t$$ Everywhere?

We know have the necessary intuition to understand one of the reasons why the function $$e^{t}$$ is so important early 
on in learning calculus: *it is the most useful prototype model for exponential growth*. Using the base $$e$$ lets 
us take advantage of it's properties even when extending the model to a more useful form, $$e^{rt}$$ where 
$$r \in \mathbb{R}$$. Here's why. 

### Example

Suppose we are told that a real-world growth process can be modelled as $$3^{0.7t}$$. We could work with the 
derivative of this function by finding $$k$$ with the limit definition like we did earlier, but that's no 
fun... we can do better! Let's write this with base $$e$$[^3]:

$$
\begin{aligned}
3^{0.7t} = e^{rt} &\implies (3^{0.7})^{t} = (e^r)^t  \\
&\implies r = \ln 3^{0.7} \approx 0.769
\end{aligned}
$$

so we can model the process as $$e^{0.769t}$$ (or with a more precise approximation of $$r$$) and still take 
advantage of all the nifty differentiation properties! Given that

$$
\frac{d}{dt}e^{rt} = re^{rt}
$$

We already know that the function $$0.769e^{0.769t}$$ tells us how this function grows.

So in short $$e$$ is used because we can.

## Before Part 2

Even if you are someone who has known the rule $$\frac{d}{dt} e^t = e^t$$ for a long time and used it over 
in calc courses, I still think it is useful to see why this is actually the case; it is simply the 
nature exponential growth. 

However, at this point feel somewhat unsatisfied, don't you? Sure, we now have a way to calculate $$e$$ to a 
very high number of decimal places, but a limit definition like $$e = \lim_{h \to 0} (h+1)^{\frac{1}{h}}$$ is 
rather uninteresting. It surely doesn't deliver on my initial promise! So let's dig deeper in **Part 2**.

[^2]: should probably site this?
[^3]: much of these results apply to the more general model $$C a^{rt}$$ as well
[^4]: we could actually use any positive real number base for this, it is not a special property of $$e$$
