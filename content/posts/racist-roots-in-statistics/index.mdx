The development of statstics was intimately linked with the advancement of white supremacist ideas.
Most notably, in many ways it went hand in hand with the development of **eugenics**, the widely discredited practice 
of "improving" the human gene pool by the 
exclusion of those deemed inferior and the inclusion of those deemed superior[^0]. 

The term *eugenics* 
was coined by none other than Francis Galton &mdash; statistical founding father and cousin of Charles Darwin &mdash;
to describe his own research.[^1] Beginning with him, three generations of white men would radically transform
statistics, the scientific method itself, and advance white supremacist ideas.

## Three Generations of Eugenacists

Francis Galton, Karl Pearson, and Ronald Fisher.




## In Their Own Words

Don't take my word for it - they were very clear about their beliefs and scientific aims. Keep in mind that 
these are not statements pulled from private correspondence or cherry picked out of context. These men were 
proud of their work, and proud to represent them in public forums. As Angela Saini points out, this is not 
the story of uniquely evil men, but the story of dangerous ideas that gained footholds in mainstream culture 
with the help of influential scientists.[^1]

#### Francis Galton (1822-1911)

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Out of the hundreds and thousands of species that have been tamed, very few indeed are fertile when their liberty is restricted and their 
struggles for livelihood are abolished; those which are so, and are otherwise useful to man, becoming domesticated. There is perhaps some 
connection between this obscure action and the disappearance of most savage races when brought into contact with high civilization, though 
there are other and well-known concomitant causes. But while most barbarous races disappear, some, like the negro, do not.

#### Karl Pearson (1857-1936)

He wrote

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
My view â€“ and I think it may be called the scientific view of a nation, is that of an organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal 
efficiency by insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency 
by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races.
</span>

In his 1901 book.[^3]

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
No degenerate and feeble stock will ever be converted into healthy and sound stock by the accumulated effects of education, good laws, and sanitary surroundings. Such means may render the individual members of a stock passable if not strong members of society, but the same process will have to be gone through again and again with their offspring, and this in ever-widening circles, if the stock, owing to the conditions in which society has placed it, is able to increase its numbers.

##### His legacy in statistics?

#### Ronald Fisher (1890-1962)

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Available scientific knowledge provides a firm basis for believing that the groups of mankind differ in their innate 
capacity for intellectual and emotional development
</span>


He formally objected to a worldwide statement decrying racism after World War II stating that human groups, i.e. racial groups, differ profoundly
"in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development" and concluded that the practical international problem is that of learning 
to share the resources of this planet amicably with persons of materially different nature" as opposed to the project of discrediting racial 
pseudoscience.[^4]

## Objective Science

Let's return to Galton. We don't need to read between the lines to discover his aims; he tells us in *Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and Aims*.[^2]

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Eugenics is the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to 
the utmost advantage. 
</span>

His praise for his mentor is even more disturbing. Pearson lets it be known that if he "wanted to know how to manage the women of a 
treacherous African tribe, I should go to Francis Galton...." Measurement and control. They knew statistics and the greater tools of science 
were made for these tasks. What are we, as practicing scientists, to think about this?

With all these thinkers and countless contemporaries, we find racist ideas hiding behind the guise of *objectivity*. With Fisher,
we saw that he believed that science showed clearly that people from different races had different innate capacities for intellect, 
emotional intelligence, and other things of that nature. That is, he believed that try as they might, other races could never match
the heights of intelligence that Europeans and white Americans have acheived. This is of course ridiculous, but is a really great 
example of rhetoric that is still wielded today. Armed with measurements and data, obtained soundly or not, people like Fisher will argue 
that it is not racist to relay what the data are saying. The data itself is objective, right?


## What Do We Make of This?

It's very important for us to engage with how our tools are *wielded* in society, not just with the uses that we believe are proper
and logical. For one, clearly accomplished statisticians like Fisher can have unreasonable and downright harmful views on what a 
proper use of the tools are in the first place.
