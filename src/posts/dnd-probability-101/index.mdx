## Intuition

*If you know some probabiity already, feel free to skip this introduction!*

------

What do we know about rolling a single die like the 20-sided d20 (I'll be using $$D_{20}$$ from now on)? Besides our special 
lucky dice that can always be counted on for a natural 20, we know that every number on the die has an *equal probability of
being rolled*. A 20 is no more likely than a 1, or 7, or a 13. Let's look at the probability of a natural 1 on a single roll:

$$
\frac{\text{number of ways to roll a }1}{\text{total number of possibilities}} = \frac{1}{20}
$$

Notice that the specific value we are looking for doesn't actually matter! Whether we do the calculation for 1 or 20, the 
probability will still be $$\frac{1}{20}$$


## Rolling the Dice... Mathematically

put stuff about pmf etc. here

$$
D_{20} = \text{a single roll of a 20-sided die}
$$

pmf

$$
p(D_{20} = k) = \frac{1}{20} 
$$

where $k=1,2,...,20$.

### Expected Value

So we now know that for any single d20 roll, all outcomes are equally probable. But what about after many rolls - what is the average roll we expect in a session?
To answer this question we turn to the concept of expected value.

$$
E[X] = \sum^{n}_{k=1} k p(k)
$$

Here is what it looks like for the d20

$$
E[D_{20}] = \sum_{k=1}^{20} k p(k) = \sum_{k=1}^{20} k (\frac{1}{20}) = 1(\frac{1}{20}) + 2(\frac{1}{20}) + \cdots + 20(\frac{1}{20}) = 10.5
$$
